# nodetcltk

**Nodetcltk** is a node extension to provide access to the one and magnificient libtk. So, you can create GUIs with this. You can use JavaScript callbacks in the GUI and you can execute Tcl code from node and obtain the results.

In short, it is a nifty way to write Desktop applications.

# Installation

You may want to change `binding.gyp` to reflect the location of your `libtcl` headers.

    npm install
    node-gyp build

# Examples

See `example.js` and `example2.js` and behold the power of **nodetk**!
